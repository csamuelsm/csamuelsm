### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Science student at UFCA (Universidade Federal do Cariri). I'm interested in many subjects from CS, with a particular inclination towards **Artificial Inteligence**, **Network Science** and **Scientific Computing**.

ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a research project in Natural Language Processing applied to detection of stress. 

ğŸŒ± Meanwhile I'm studying Network and Complexity Science and interested in alternatives to Gradient Descent on Artificial Intelligence models.
