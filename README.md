### Hi there 👋

I'm a Computer Science student at UFCA (Universidade Federal do Cariri). I'm interested in many subjects from CS, with a particular inclination towards **Artificial Inteligence**, **Network Science** and **Scientific Computing**.

🔭 I’m currently working on a research project in **Graph Theory**.

🌱 Meanwhile I'm studying about **Deep Learning** and **Network Science**, and I also like to read and know more about *game making*, *design*, *science and maths*.
